        <p class="typewriter">Hello! I'm <strong style="color: white;">JEGADESH</strong>, a passionate Web Developer with a love for creating intuitive and dynamic user experiences. With a background in Electronics and Communication, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS to build responsive websites that not only look great but also function seamlessly. I enjoy exploring new technologies and staying updated with the latest trends in web development. In my spare time, I work on personal projects, contribute to open-source initiatives, and engage with the developer community through forums and meetups. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing cricket, listening to songs. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead and eager to connect with like-minded individuals!</p>
